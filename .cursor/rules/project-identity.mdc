# The Navigator - Project Identity

## Project Overview

**Kariem Seiam's Portfolio Website** - "The Navigator" themed production-ready React single-page application. A portfolio showcasing a full-stack developer's work with a distinctive design inspired by desert sunsets, cosmic imagery, and navigation/exploration metaphors.

**Live URL**: https://kariemseiam.github.io/portfolio/
**Theme**: "A developer who builds bridges between worlds" - Arabic ↔ English | Mobile ↔ Web | Code ↔ Impact

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| React | 18.3.1 | Component-based UI with hooks (NO TypeScript) |
| Vite | 6.0.3 | Build tool and dev server |
| Tailwind CSS | 3.4.17 | Utility-first styling with extensive customizations |
| Lucide React | 0.469.0 | Icon library (only icon source) |
| ESLint | 9.39.1 | Code linting |

## Architecture Pattern

```
src/
├── components/              # React components by SECTION (not by type)
│   ├── About/               # About section components
│   ├── Career/              # Career timeline components
│   ├── Hero/                # Hero section components
│   ├── Projects/            # Projects gallery components
│   ├── Shared/              # Shared UI components (Nav, Theme, etc.)
│   └── Skills/              # Skills section components
├── data/                    # Content data files (EDIT THESE to update content)
├── hooks/                   # Custom React hooks (use* prefix)
├── utils/                   # Shared utilities and constants
├── App.jsx                  # Main app with lazy-loaded sections
├── index.css                # Global styles with CSS variables (~6700 lines)
└── main.jsx                 # Entry point
```

## Design Philosophy

### The Navigator Metaphor
- **Navigator** (Coral) - Primary accent, signature color
- **Compass** (Gold) - Guidance, CTAs, secondary accent
- **Horizon** (Teal) - Exploration, links, tertiary accent
- **Pathfinder** (Indigo) - Technical, code elements
- **Growth** (Green) - Success, evolution indicators

### Visual Language
- Warm ivory backgrounds in light mode, cosmic black in dark mode
- Geometric patterns, corner accents, flowing curves
- Parallax effects and staggered animations
- Cards as "windows into the journey"

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server (--host enabled, port 5173)
npm run build    # Production build with Terser minification
npm run preview  # Preview production build
npm run lint     # ESLint check (js, jsx files)
```

## Critical Rules

### ✅ DO
- Use JSX only (this is NOT a TypeScript project)
- Import icons ONLY from `lucide-react`
- Use CSS variables for colors: `rgb(var(--navigator))`
- Respect the section-based folder structure
- Follow the Navigator design metaphor naming

### ❌ DON'T
- Don't add TypeScript files or types
- Don't use other icon libraries (Font Awesome, Heroicons, etc.)
- Don't use inline colors - use CSS variables or Tailwind classes
- Don't create components outside the established structure
- Don't use class components - hooks only
